## AI PROJECT 
**Objective**:AI Text Generation Model: Create a model to generate coherent text based on given inputs.  
**Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow  
**Role**: Built and optimized the model for different temperature values.  
**Results**: Achieved high-quality outputs demonstrating nuanced control of language tone.
