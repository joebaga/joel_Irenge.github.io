## AI Projects
### Drug-Target Interaction Prediction for Neglected Tropical Diseases

- **Objective:** Predict drug-target interactions (DTI) for neglected tropical diseases like Leishmaniasis and African sleeping sickness using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models.
- **Background:** These diseases are included in the WHO's list of major global health burdens, but there is limited commercial interest in their treatment. Traditional ANN and machine learning models struggle with the complex interactions between diseases and drugs.
- **Technologies:** Python, GCN
- **Role:** Developed models to learn intricate interactions between protein and molecular variables, addressing data imbalance issues and utilizing pooled embedding vectors.
- **Results:** Demonstrated that the GCN model significantly improves DTI prediction performance.

)
- **Objective:** Develop a model to generate animation-like characters.
- **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Anime Face Dataset
- **Role:** Downloaded dataset, trained the model, and fine-tuned for accuracy.
- **Results:** Generated visually accurate animation faces.

### Fashion Analyzer

- **Objective:** Analyze fashion trends based on images, providing users with style year, trend data, and keywords.
- **Technologies:** PyTorch, Flutter, Python
- **Role:** Implemented the AI model, designed the app UI, and handled data preprocessing.
- **Results:** High accuracy (up to 96.95%) in trend analysis; successfully delivered user-friendly insights.
